# mbed code for motor controller

The project `.bin` file is generated by the online mbed compiler.

Upload all of the source code onto the online compiler, and make sure the target is set as `LPC1768`.

Include the `mbed-rtos` library beforehand in order for the code to compile.


## Servo

The servo is controlled by a PWM signal of 50Hz or 20ms. A pulse width of 500 microseconds corresponds to 0 degrees, 2500 microseconds corresponds to 180 degrees, and linear scaling inbetween.

## Message Format

The mbed receives messages about the next target joint angles in the format of `<J1J2J3J4J5>`. Each joint uses 2 characters (2 bytes) which describes the target angle in hexademical.

As of now, this message format is able to receive ~100 messages per second when the UART comms is set to 9600bits/sec. The minimum angle resolution is 1 degree.

## Implementation

Each motor control is run by its own thread, allowing simultaneous execution of all 5 servo motors.
