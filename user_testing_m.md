# User Testing - Methodology
*to be updated throughout the user testing process*

An overview on:
* Participant selection
* Hypotheses to test
  * Experiment to perform
  * Corresponding control experiment
* Experiment metrics (qualitative/quantitative)

## Hypothesis: Gestures to move Luko's gaze aids productivity
* Prove that manually moving a lamp across areas of a desk is cumbersome
* Then prove that this is solved with gestures

Experiment:
* A dynamic task switching between 2 laptops/notebooks placed ~1ft away from each other (tune size)
* Measure number of subtasks completed within a set time (~2mins) - constrain task such that lamp must face workspace
